<p>So I think is prudent to start considering about writing itself. But, maybe, I should
    also consider what this blog should be. This blog will be mainly done in written
    language instead of photos. Some images I shall use here will be to register synoptic
    information only. Especially since I don't have the resources to produce beautiful
    images with advertising appeal. So I better stick to the quality of the information
    itself, stick to the quality of what is said, which is already a very difficult task,
    sufficient, in my view, for my purposes. As for the nature of what I'm going to write,
    it's about what I'm studying, what I'm thinking about and what I'm working on. That's
    why this blog tends to be very eclectic, with content ranging from concrete to
    abstruse, from the exact sciences to abstract philosophy.</p>

<p>In order to get a good classification of my posts I'm thinking about using two groups
    of markers, the first one that makes a division between exact, abstract or mingled.
    The second that makes a gradation of the first on terms of solid, mixture, liquid,
    abstruse and gas. A question that might arise is whether these three gradations are
    present in the two natures that the first classification gives. I believe it is
    possible that even in the exact sciences, the state of the knowledge, especially from
    the author, could be in a construction phase so the text production will have a very
    volatile nature, as much as a gas. And the same could be said of a very abstract
    philosophy but one that is constructed in terms so logically concrete and rationally
    linked that we might as well label a solid gradation. In addition to these first two
    classifications, it is necessary to determine and indicate the subjects that each post
    is about.</p>

<p>The ideal procedure to compose a good text would be, before starting to write the text
    content, to determine the working title and which markers that text is expected
    to meet. Even though the labels and title can change as the text is written, it is
    always interesting to keep in mind what is the expected nature for that text. It is,
    therefore, appropriate to make a short effort to describe which system of markers I
    expect to use.</p>

<p>Now I should write about the writing itself.</p>

<p>I good way to keep track on what posts, some content development is necessary, is to
    include the /*TODO*/ sign. By this way with a simple search it's easy to identify
    which parts of the blog need some attention. It is also interesting in these cases to
    indicate after the sign what needs to be done.</p>
