<p>I'm a software engineer and a free thinker. Thus, I love to develop algorithms and data
    structures in the most diverse languages, from C to Web, and, likewise, I love to
    write about the most diverse subjects, from exact sciences to abstract philosophy. My
    interests are in the fields of informatics and information, technology and
    epistemology, intelligence and wisdom. These pairs of interests also synthesizes what
    I believe to be the ideal synergy between practice and theoretical knowledge.</p>
