# Unix Users

On the Unix family operating systems all execution is performed by one user. To perform
each operation, each user will have to go through the validation of their authorizations
in accessing the system resources needed for that execution.

To add an user to the a group we use the following command:

`sudo usermod -a -G groupName userName`
